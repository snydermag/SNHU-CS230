Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room would like to develop a web-based version of their game Draw It or Lose It. The game is currently only available as an Android application, so they need CTS to set up an environment that can serve multiple platforms. The game needs to have the ability to have one or more teams involved and each team will have multiple players. The game and team names require unique names and only one instance of the game can exist at one time.


What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe I was able to explain the different aspects of the project in a way that clients who aren't well versed in technology would be able to understand. It's one thing to be able to implement a project for a client, but it's more important to get the client to see the importance of each and every recommendation we have for them. This would be a large expense for a company, so the client needs to know what they are paying for. 


What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Breaking down the different requirements of the application helped narrow down what can and should be done for this particular application. Understanding where the client is and where they would like to be sets good parameters for what needs to be done. By breaking down all of the requirements, it sets up a nice checklist of the tasks that will need to be completed for the application to be implemented.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would like to revise the recommendations. I think I could do some more reasearch on the different options for the client and given more diffinitive decisions on what the plan should be for the application.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

As a mobile app user myself, I understand what I like and don't like about different applications. Applications are designed to be used. Keeping the user experience in mind should be the first priority when designing any application. If an application is poorly laid out or runs poorly, people won't use it and without users, what is the point of an application?


How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing the software by starting with the needs of the user and once those bases were covered, I moved on to what could go wrong. For example, I included a recommendation for a firewall for the server to protect user data. If someone were to try and hack into the server, our customer's information could be stolen. It's important to consider as many scenarios as possible where something could go wrong. It's better to be over prepared than under prepared.
